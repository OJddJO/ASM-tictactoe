In x86-64 assembly, registers are small storage locations within the CPU that are used to hold data temporarily during program execution. Here are the main types of registers and their purposes:

---

### **General-Purpose Registers**
These are used for arithmetic, data movement, and other general operations. They are 64-bit registers but can also be accessed in smaller portions (32-bit, 16-bit, or 8-bit).

| **Register** | **Purpose** (Convention)                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rax`        | Accumulator register. Often used for return values from functions or arithmetic results. |
| `rbx`        | Base register. Preserved across function calls (callee-saved).                          |
| `rcx`        | Counter register. Often used for loops or string operations.                            |
| `rdx`        | Data register. Used for I/O operations or as a secondary accumulator.                   |
| `rsi`        | Source index. Used for string operations or as a function argument.                     |
| `rdi`        | Destination index. Used for string operations or as a function argument.                |
| `rsp`        | Stack pointer. Points to the top of the stack.                                           |
| `rbp`        | Base pointer. Points to the base of the current stack frame.                            |
| `r8`–`r15`   | Additional general-purpose registers.                                                   |

### **Segment Registers**
These are used for memory segmentation (less common in modern 64-bit programming).

| **Register** | **Purpose**                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `cs`         | Code segment (instruction pointer). |
| `ds`         | Data segment.                  |
| `es`, `fs`, `gs`, `ss` | Other segment registers. |

---

### **Instruction Pointer**
| **Register** | **Purpose**                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `rip`        | Holds the address of the next instruction to execute. |

---

### **Flags Register**
| **Register** | **Purpose**                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `rflags`     | Holds flags for condition codes (e.g., zero flag, carry flag). |

---

### **Floating-Point and SIMD Registers**
Used for floating-point and vector operations.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| `xmm0`–`xmm15` | 128-bit registers for SIMD operations. |
| `ymm0`–`ymm15` | 256-bit registers (AVX).      |

### **In Your Code**
- `rsi`: Used as a pointer to the first string in `strcmp`.
- `rdi`: Used as a pointer to the second string in `strcmp`.
- `rax`: Used to store the return value of the function.
- `al`: The lower 8 bits of `rax`, used to compare individual characters.
- `bl`: The lower 8 bits of `rbx`, used to compare individual characters.
